## Design
This is a heavily refactored project. I focused mainly on clean code and designed this as a flexible foundtation for further chess related projects to be built from (i.e. multiplayer and chess engine implementation).

## Construction
- MVVM
- SwiftUI
- Unit Testing
- Networking with swift server (multiplayer branch)
